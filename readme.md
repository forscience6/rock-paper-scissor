This project allows the player to play a simple game of rock paper and scissor against the computer.

-script.html: contains a javascript script which prompts the player to pick between rock, paper, or scissor and the player's selection is pitted against the computer's selection(random) for 5 rounds and the winner is announced at the end.

-script2.html: same as script.html except with a GUI in the browser. Has added html elements along with a modified javascript script as well as style.css style sheet to make the whole app more visual.
